    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Raskolnikov, a destitute and desperate former student, wanders through the slums of St Petersburg and commits a
        random murder without remorse or regret. He imagines himself to be a great man, a Napoleon: acting for a higher
        purpose beyond conventional moral law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a suspicious
        police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his
        own guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden sex worker, can offer the chance of redemption.
