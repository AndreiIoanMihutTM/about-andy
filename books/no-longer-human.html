    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Osamu Dazai's No Longer Human, this leading postwar Japanese writer's second novel, tells the poignant and
        fascinating story of a young man who is caught between the breakup of the traditions of a northern Japanese
        aristocratic family and the impact of Western ideas. In consequence, he feels himself "disqualified from being
        human" (a literal translation of the Japanese title).
    </p>
    <p>Donald Keene, who translated this and Dazai's first novel, The Setting Sun, has said of the author's work: "His
        world … suggests Chekhov or possibly postwar France, … but there is a Japanese sensibility in the choice and
        presentation of the material. A Dazai novel is at once immediately intelligible in Western terms and quite
        unlike any Western book." His writing is in some ways reminiscent of Rimbaud, while he himself has often been
        called a forerunner of Yukio Mishima.
