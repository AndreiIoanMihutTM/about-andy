    <h1>Piata Victoriei</h1>
    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p>The Victory Square (Romanian: <em>Piața Victoriei</em>), known until 1990 as the Opera Square (Romanian: Piața
        Operei), is
        the central square of Timișoara. It is the place where Timișoara was proclaimed on 20 December 1989 the first
        city free of communism in Romania. It was a main boulevard, transformed into a square after the closure of
        the southern side by the construction of the Metropolitan Cathedral. The opposite poles of the square consist of
        the Opera to the north and the Metropolitan Cathedral to the south. From the Opera to the Cathedral the
        promenade on the right is called Corso, and the one on the left is called <em>Surogat</em>. Both have protected
        architectural ensembles of local historical importance.</p>
    <p>The square hosts the buildings of some important institutions such as the National Theater and Opera, the
        Orthodox Cathedral, Timiș, Capitol and Studio cinemas, the Museum of Banat, several art galleries as well as
        many shops and sidewalk cafés. Some of the most important cultural events take place in Victory Square: JazzTM,
        Timfloralis, FEST-FDR, Opera and Operetta Festival, Easter and Christmas fairs, New Year's concerts, etc.
