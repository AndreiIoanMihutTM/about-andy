    <h1>Reading</h1>
    <p>Reading is the processof taking in the sense or meaning of letters, symbols, etc., especially by sight or touch.
    </p>
    <p>For educators and researcher, reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as word recognition,
        orthography (spelling), alphabetics, phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and
        motivation.</p>
    <p>Reading is typically an individual activity, done silently, although on occasion a person reads out loud for
        other listeners; or reads aloud for one's own use, for better comprehension. Before the reintroduction of
        separated text (spaces between words) in the late Middle Ages, the ability to read silently was considered
        rather remarkable.</p>
    <p>Major predictors of an individual's ability to read both alphabetic and non-alphabetic scripts are oral language
        skills, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and verbal IQ.</p>
    <p>As a leisure activity, children and adults read because it is pleasant and interesting. In the US, about half of
        all adults read one or more books for pleasure each year. About 5% read more than 50 books per year. Americans
        read more if they: have more education, read fluently and easily, are female, live in cities, and have higher
        socioeconomic status. Children become better readers when they know more about the world in general, and when
        they perceive reading as fun rather than another chore to be performed</p>
